## 📊 Project Overview

This project showcases my end-to-end data analysis and visualization process using PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin) and Power BI. The dataset simulates a real-world HR system, including information about employees, departments, salaries, attendance, training, and performance evaluations.

The goal is to demonstrate:

- SQL querying and data extraction skills
   
- Data modeling and transformation across HR domains
  
- Interactive business intelligence storytelling using Power BI

## 🧩 Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database includes the following tables:

- `employees`, `departments`, `positions`, `salaries`, `attendance`, `leaves`, `trainings`, `evaluations`

Each table is connected through proper primary/foreign key relationships and simulates realistic HR operations in a medium-sized organization.
